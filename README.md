# React-News-Portal
It is a internship assignment
To develop the React News Portal as described, we'll break down the tasks and provide a simple implementation using functional components, React hooks, Redux Toolkit for state management, and integration with a public news API (specifically using NewsAPI).

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Project Setup
First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, create a new React application using Create React App:
Structure and Components
Organize your project structure:

src/
components/
Article.js: Component to display each article.
ArticleDetail.js: Component for detailed view of an article.
CategoryFilter.js: Component for filtering articles by category.
Pagination.js: Component for pagination of articles.
Loader.js: Component for loading state during API calls.
pages/
Home.js: Homepage displaying articles.
ArticlePage.js: Detailed view of an article.
redux/
store.js: Redux store configuration.
slices/
articlesSlice.js: Redux slice for managing articles state.
Components Implementation
Implement the required components (Home.js, Article.js, ArticleDetail.js, CategoryFilter.js, Pagination.js, Loader.js) using React hooks for state management and Redux for managing global state.

7. Styling
Apply basic styling using Bootstrap or custom CSS for responsiveness. Ensure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.

8. Routing
Use React Router to set up routing between different pages (Home and ArticlePage).

9. Error Handling and Loading States
Display loading indicators (Loader.js) during API requests and handle errors (articlesSlice.js) to provide a smooth user experience.

10. Final Steps
Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) and provide a live link.
Record a video demonstrating the application and explaining your implementation.
Upload the project to GitHub and share the repository link.
This structure and approach provide a robust foundation for building a React News Portal with essential features like article fetching, category filtering, pagination, and detailed article views. Adjustments can be made based on specific API requirements or additional features like search and favorites, as mentioned in the advanced tasks.
